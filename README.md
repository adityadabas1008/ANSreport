# ANSreport

You can start by setting up GIT on your pc, I personally use GIT bash on my windows.

-> After the basic setup steps, you must have cloned the repository on your pc following the steps shown on GitHub
I recommend you to read the GIT_WORKFLOW.txt file to understand the basic steps and way we keep the report up-to-date.

I will be updating the contents of this repository soon.
